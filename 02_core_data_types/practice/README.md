# Python Data Structures Assignment

This repository contains Python exercises completed as part of a software development bootcamp, focusing on **core Python data structures** and their practical use in real-world scenarios.

## Topics Covered

- **Lists**
  - Collected and stored user input
  - Used lists of dictionaries to model structured data
  - Demonstrated mutability and in-place modification

- **Dictionaries**
  - Stored key–value data using meaningful identifiers
  - Used nested dictionaries for complex data (e.g. contact details)
  - Safely accessed data using `.get()`
  - Added, updated, and deleted dictionary entries

- **Sets**
  - Removed duplicate values
  - Performed set operations (union, intersection, difference)
  - Used sets for efficient membership testing

## Practical Exercises

- **Contact Book**
  - Implemented a contact book using dictionaries
  - Stored contact names as keys and contact details as nested dictionaries
  - Added validation and JSON save/load functionality

- **Inventory Management**
  - Represented inventory as a list of dictionaries
  - Calculated total inventory value
  - Identified the highest-priced product
  - Applied formatted output for currency values

- **To-Do List**
  - Built a task list using a list of dictionaries
  - Tracked completion status using booleans
  - Filtered and displayed pending tasks

## Key Concepts
- Mutable vs immutable data types
- Nested data structures and object references
- Choosing the appropriate data structure for a given problem

## Tools Used
- Python
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub
