# Python Basics – Bootcamp Exercises

This repository contains a set of introductory Python exercises completed as part of a software development bootcamp. The focus of this project is on setting up a professional Python development environment and understanding common developer workflows.

## Exercises Covered

### 1. Python Environment Inspection
- Created a Python script that imports the `sys` module
- Printed the Python version and executable path
- Ran the script from the command line to confirm the active virtual environment

### 2. Virtual Environments and Package Management
- Created a new project folder
- Set up and activated a Python virtual environment (`.venv`)
- Installed the `requests` package using `pip`
- Verified installed packages using `pip freeze`

### 3. Linting with Pylint
- Configured VS Code to use Pylint
- Created a script with an unused variable
- Observed linting warnings in the VS Code Problems tab

### 4. Formatter and Execution Workflow (UML)
- Created a UML sequence diagram illustrating:
  - Writing code in VS Code
  - Automatic formatting with Black on save
  - Running the script in the integrated terminal

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Virtual Environments (`venv`)
- VS Code
- Pylint
- Black
- Git & GitHub

## Notes
- The virtual environment (`.venv`) is excluded from version control using `.gitignore`
- VS Code project-specific settings are included for consistent linting and formatting
